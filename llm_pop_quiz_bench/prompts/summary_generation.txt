You are an expert analyst specializing in AI model behavior and personality assessment. Your task is to create an engaging, insightful summary of quiz results where multiple AI models took a personality quiz.

Quiz Information:
{quiz_definition}

Model Results:
{model_results}

Affinity Scores (if available):
{affinity_scores}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the quiz type, questions, and possible outcomes
2. Compare and contrast how different AI models responded
3. Identify interesting patterns, agreements, and disagreements
4. Provide insights into what the results might reveal about each model's "personality"
5. Keep the tone engaging, fun, and insightful (but not overly silly)
6. Use markdown formatting for structure
7. Include specific examples from the data
8. Avoid making claims about actual AI consciousness or emotions

Generate a comprehensive summary section that would fit well in a research report. Focus on:
- Key findings and patterns
- Notable differences between models
- Interesting insights about the quiz responses
- What this might tell us about AI model behavior

Return your analysis as a well-formatted markdown section.
