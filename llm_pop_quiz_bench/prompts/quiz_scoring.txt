You are an expert at analyzing personality quiz results and determining outcomes.

Given a quiz definition and a model's responses, determine which outcome/personality the model achieved.

Quiz Definition:
{quiz_definition}

Model Responses:
{model_responses}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the quiz structure and scoring mechanism
2. Look at the model's choices for each question
3. Apply the quiz's scoring rules to determine the outcome
4. Return the result as a simple string (the personality/outcome name)

If the quiz uses:
- "mostly" scoring: Count which choice letter (A/B/C/D/E/F) appears most frequently
- Tag-based scoring: Look at option tags and count frequencies
- Point-based scoring: Sum up scores from chosen options
- Custom logic: Apply any other scoring mechanism described

Return ONLY the outcome name/text, nothing else.
